# Lightweaver — branded LED installation controller

## What this is
Custom LED lighting control platform for laser-cut art installations. **Project name: Lightweaver.** Lighting software: Madrix (Art-Net output). Target: a web interface accessible from phone or browser.

## Current plan — ESP32-only (Pi deferred)
As of 2026-06 the runtime is **ESP32-S3 only**. The card runs the Lightweaver firmware and **serves its own branded scene-selector page (the visitor UI)** plus the WLED-compat JSON/WS API at `lightweaver.local` / `192.168.4.1`. The public Studio at `led.mandalacodes.com` is the design/export surface and reaches the card directly on the LAN / via the card-page postMessage bridge. **There is no Raspberry Pi in the runtime path.** A Pi integration is planned for later — `lightweaver/server/` (the WLED proxy), `visitor-ui/`, and `docs/pi-hosted-deployment.md` are kept for that future but are not part of the current plan; do not treat them as the live runtime or invest in them unless the Pi work is explicitly resumed.

## Current contents
- `research.md` — hardware options (ESP32-S3, WLED firmware, Madrix integration), Art-Net/E1.31 protocols, control architecture, color management
- `branded-installation-ui.md` — visitor-facing branded UI design spec (captive portal, scene selector)
- `led-art-mapper/` — Vite app for designing LED strip paths over artwork SVGs; exports `ledmap.json` for WLED
- `lightweaver/` — React Studio/control app, Pi proxy server (deferred), controller package export, and runtime contract tests
- `firmware/lightweaver-controller/` — standalone ESP32-S3 Lightweaver card firmware for local playback
- `docs/deployment-checklist.md` — bench-to-gallery checklist, including code/runtime launch gate

## Key decisions from research
- **WLED firmware** recommended for quick start (100+ effects, REST/JSON API, Art-Net support)
- **Architecture options**: standalone ESP32-S3 card for local playback; WLED on ESP32-S3 with Pi-hosted UI (deferred); Madrix sends Art-Net for advanced/live installations
- **Public UI split**: `led.mandalacodes.com` is the public Studio/setup/support surface. Actual LED commands stay local through the card page, WLED UI, Pi proxy (deferred), or another local bridge.
- **Launch gate**: before deployment, run `npm run launch:check` from `lightweaver/`, then complete the hardware and site smoke tests in `docs/deployment-checklist.md`.

## Fast development loop — mandatory

Use `docs/development-workflow.md` as the source of truth for proportional
verification. Default to the glitch loop for an individual browser or UI defect.

- “Build” means implement the approved idea and verify it; it never means stop
  after writing a spec or plan.
- In the glitch loop, write one focused regression, witness red, implement the
  smallest fix, witness green, and inspect the real screen. Do not run the full
  launch gate for each glitch.
- Do not bump firmware, rebuild or sign release artifacts, deploy, or flash
  hardware for browser-only changes. Batch related browser fixes into a
  checkpoint first.
- Do not flash hardware unless the change actually requires firmware proof or
  Adrian explicitly asks for a release. Never flash a configured card with the
  destructive factory image without first recording a recovery path for its
  Wi-Fi and project configuration.
- Keep one stable preview. Do not leave a second Vite server running while
  browser tests execute.
- If a check needs Adrian's eyes, add it to a visual-feedback list and continue
  every independent non-visual check. Do not pause the whole workstream.
- Run the checkpoint gate once after a coherent batch. Run the release gate only
  when shipping. The exhaustive workflow is release evidence, not an editing
  loop.

## Three inferred operating modes — mandatory

Do not require Adrian to remember mode names or special commands. Infer the mode
from ordinary language, say which mode you selected in one short sentence, and
continue unless the Prove authorization rule requires a pause.

| Adrian's request | Mode |
| --- | --- |
| Features, glitches, interface problems, a list of issues, or “keep going” | **Sprint** |
| He is present with lights, colors, pixel counts, strips, wiring, USB, power cycles, or a physical card observation | **Bench** |
| “Prove Lightweaver” | **Prove**, explicitly authorized |
| “Check everything”, “confirm it is all working”, or similar exhaustive language | **Prove candidate**; state that it is the long run and obtain confirmation before starting |
| “Ship”, “push to main”, or “deploy” | Existing release workflow; ship does not authorize and does not silently invoke Prove |

If a request is ambiguous between Sprint and Bench, default to Sprint until an
immediate physical observation is actually required. Never infer authorization
for Prove from urgency, a release request, a checkpoint, or available time.

Use `LIGHTWEAVER_WORKBOARD.md` as the cross-session state. Only the primary agent
edits it. Sub-agents return evidence to the primary instead of editing the board.

- **Sprint:** the primary may use at most three useful sub-agents on independent,
  non-overlapping ownership boundaries and remains the sole integrator. Use a
  balanced/default model for bounded work and reserve frontier/deeper reasoning
  for firmware, persistence, security, or cross-boundary authority. Run one
  integrated checkpoint after the coherent batch.
- **Bench:** automate every machine action and ask for one physical observation
  at a time. Record the exact session and one resumption step. Never mark a
  visual hardware gate passed yourself.
- **Prove:** freeze feature changes, run the exhaustive matrix, and distinguish
  automated proof, observed hardware proof, waivers, and unperformed gates.

Detailed execution rules live in `docs/workflows/sprint.md`,
`docs/workflows/bench.md`, and `docs/workflows/prove.md`.

## Project name
**Lightweaver** — use this name in UI copy, WiFi SSIDs (`Lightweaver-XXXX` MAC-suffix format for the card AP), and any public-facing branding.

## Public web / GitHub
- **Parent site**: `mandalacodes.com` is Adrian Rasmussen's site.
- **Canonical public Lightweaver UI URL**: `led.mandalacodes.com`.
- **LED repo GitHub**: `git@github-tech:adroart/LED-Programming.git`.
- **Mandala Codes repo GitHub**: `git@github-tech:technicianofthesacred/mandalacodes.git`.
- **Deployment split**: the Lightweaver browser UI lives at `led.mandalacodes.com`. Keep the actual LED command path local (card page, WLED UI, or local bridge) — public HTTPS pages cannot reliably command local HTTP controllers from every phone/browser.

## Shipment vocabulary and standing authorization

Use these words precisely in every Lightweaver handoff:

- **Committed**: the change exists in a local Git commit. It is not necessarily on GitHub.
- **Pushed**: a remote branch contains the commit. It is not necessarily reviewed or on `origin/main`.
- **PR-ready**: the pushed branch has its required tests and a truthful ready-for-review pull request. It is not merged.
- **Merged**: the integrated change is contained in `origin/main`. It is not necessarily deployed.
- **Deployed**: the production workflow used real production credentials, published the exact integrated revision, and succeeded. A credential-skipped green workflow is not deployed.
- **Shipped**: the work was tested, merged into `origin/main`, deployed successfully, and then independently proven live at `https://led.mandalacodes.com` by its strict no-store `/studio-release.json` revision and the exact deployed files in the staged build graph.

Every **Deployed** and **Shipped** report must name the **build numbers** —
the repository's commit count, which is exactly the number GitHub prints as
"N Commits" at the top of the file list. The owner checks GitHub, checks the
screen, and knows whether he is running the newest code. Never switch this to a
prettier counter that steps by one per change — neat increments are worthless if
they match nothing he can see. The same number is used for both surfaces:

- **Studio build** — `buildNumber` in `/studio-release.json`, shown in the
  Studio footer beacon.
- **Firmware build** — `buildNumber` in the signed
  `/firmware/release-manifest.json`, compiled into the binary as
  `LW_BUILD_NUMBER` and reported by the card on `/api/firmware-info` and
  `/api/status`. A card and the release it was flashed from always report the
  same number.

Say "Shipped — Studio build 412, firmware build 411", not just a commit SHA.
Those numbers are how the owner confirms a browser and a card are current
without decoding a hash. The two can differ by one on a firmware release,
because the signer commits the signed artifacts on top of the revision the
binary was compiled from; that is expected, not drift.

“Ship it to main” is standing authorization to complete that entire sequence,
including the integration PR, merge, production workflow, and final live proof.
A commit, push, PR, merge, or green CI result alone never satisfies it. If any
boundary cannot be crossed, report **not shipped** and name the exact last
verified state and blocker. Do not claim completion before the final live proof
against the terminal `origin/main` revision, including any protected firmware
signer commit triggered by the merge.

## Agent ownership boundaries
- `led-art-mapper/app/src/` — owned by led-art-mapper agent; do not edit
- `lightweaver/src/` — owned by lightweaver-app agent; do not edit
- `firmware/lightweaver-controller/src/` — owned by firmware agent; do not edit
- `scripts/`, `.github/`, `docs/`, root markdown files, `lightweaver/scripts/`, `lightweaver/vite.config.js`, `lightweaver/package.json` (scripts section only), `.gitignore` — owned by CI/docs agent

## Tools already built
- `led-art-mapper/` — design tool: draw LED strip paths over artwork, set pixel counts, write live patterns (JS), export `ledmap.json` / FastLED header / CSV
- `lightweaver/` — React Studio with WLED WebSocket hook, ESP32 Web Serial flasher, controller package export, and launch test script
- `firmware/lightweaver-controller/` — sellable standalone card firmware with local config page, rotary controls, and microSD sequence support
