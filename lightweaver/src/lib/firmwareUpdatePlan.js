// What installing will actually DO to the card in front of you.
//
// The install screen used to state only the firmware it was about to write. That
// answers "what is this?" but not the question an owner is really asking, which
// is "am I changing anything, and in which direction?" — and installing is never
// free: it wipes the card's Wi-Fi, its piece and its settings every time, even
// when the firmware being written is the one already on it.
//
// Both numbers are the same quantity: the card compiles in LW_BUILD_NUMBER and
// the signed manifest carries buildNumber, each the commit count of the same
// build lineage. So they compare as plain integers. A 0 or missing number means
// the card predates numbered builds, and then only "is it the same build id"
// can honestly be answered.
//
// The one rule: never imply knowledge that is not there. A card this browser has
// never met has an UNKNOWN current firmware, and the screen must say so rather
// than quietly showing only the target and letting it read as the answer.
