// The one way a setup reaches the card.
//
// Every dead end found while walking the real flow on real hardware is answered
// here, so no screen has to rediscover them:
//
//  - A card streaming frames cannot serve its own HTTP API. The browser reports
//    "could not reach the card" while the card sits there working perfectly. Put
//    the lights down first.
//  - A card that has just rebooted answers /api/status seconds before it will
//    accept a write. Wait for two clean reads, and treat an abort as "ask again",
//    never as "this failed".
//  - A wiring change the card is still holding open blocks every later write with
//    "wiring transaction is active; confirm or roll back before saving", and no
//    screen offers a way out. Roll the stale one back before writing.
//  - Staging exists to protect a layout the card is already running well. It must
//    be ACTIVATED and then CONFIRMED — activation alone starts a timed trial the
//    card silently undoes, so the setup looks installed and then is not.
//  - The reconnect watcher gives up long before a healthy card finishes booting.
//    Its timeout is not the outcome. The card's own report of what it is driving
//    is the only proof that counts.
