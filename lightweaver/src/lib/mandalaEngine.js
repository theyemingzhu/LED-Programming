// Mandala sound-reactive engine — the compute core of the listening-gallery
// visualizer, extracted from led-art-mapper/mandala-sim/index.html so the Show
// screen preview and the card frame stream share one implementation.
//
// AESTHETIC CONTRACT (binding — see docs/mandala-effects-direction-v2.md and
// docs/mandala-color-system.md, incl. the 2026-07-12 dynamics amendment):
// warm hue corridor only, B ≤ G ≤ R law, audio modulates amplitude/
// probability/position never velocity; attacks are fast (transients must
// survive — see the onset layer), releases stay eased except when a target
// collapses (the field may empty fast after a hit). The master ceiling is
// SUSTAINED: onset peaks may overdrive the wire to full brightness for the
// ~0.3s onset envelope. Under music in the Active preset the field may reach
// TRUE BLACK (the dark gate below); silence and the Calm preset keep the
// dim-coal never-black law exactly. frameRGB applies wire gamma 2.2 (the
// card firmware does NOT gamma-correct); the canvas preview stays linear.
// The constants below were hand-tuned; do NOT "improve" them.
//
// DENSITY (2026-07-13): the pattern shapes itself to the light COUNT via
// `detail` (1 at/above DENSITY_FULL active pixels → authored look byte-for-byte,
// so every dense layout incl. the 675-pixel Mandala is unchanged; → 0 sparse).
// Sparse pieces get fewer/wider geometry features and bigger sparks/hit-blooms
// so a 60-light piece reads as finished as a 600-light one. LOCALIZED HITS: a
// beat also drops a slowly-fading bloom at a PLACE (several alive at once in
// different places), added over the field — you watch each hit land and trail.
//
// No DOM. Rendering (canvas halo look) stays in the Show screen; this module
// only computes per-pixel intensity + palette selection and converts that to
// RGB frames. `createMandalaEngine()` returns an isolated instance (all state
// per-instance so tests and preview never share clocks).
//
// ============================================================================
// RANGE-PAINTING (2026-08-20) — the nine effects paint a RANGE, not "the piece"
// ============================================================================
// Every `fx*` below has the signature
//
//     fx(ctx, area, from, to, out) -> statusLine
//
// and touches ONLY the pixels `out[area.pixelIndex[j]]` for `j` in `[from,to)`.
// `area` is an AreaBinding: geometry already flattened into typed arrays so the
// paint loop never dereferences a per-pixel object. On the nine-mode path
// `tick()` hands them the WHOLE-PIECE binding (`pixelIndex[j] === j`, one
// instance, every pixel, template order) and the single range `[0, count)`, so
// the output is byte-for-byte what it was when each effect owned the loop
// itself — that equivalence is pinned by `mandalaEngine.legacyParity.test.js`,
// which replays 300 scripted ticks of all nine modes on two templates under two
// knob sets against digests captured from the pre-ensemble code. Do not change
// an effect's arithmetic without re-reading that file first.
//
// ---- THE TWO PAINT PATHS (2026-08-21) --------------------------------------
// `tick()` branches once, on whether a composition is set:
//
//   no composition -> the nine modes, exactly as above. THIS IS THE LIVE
//                     DEFAULT and the owner's instant fallback; it is pinned
//                     byte-for-byte and must never move.
//   a composition  -> `showEnsemble`'s `tickVoices(target, fxCtx)`, which
//                     paints many areas with many voices into the same flat
//                     accumulator. `setComposition()` / `clearComposition()`
//                     flip between them at runtime, no reload.
//
// Only the PAINT step branches. Fill lift, coal floor, beat substrate, hit
// blooms, silence decay and the per-pixel envelope are whole-piece passes that
// run once per tick BELOW the branch, on both paths. Do not move any of them
// into a per-voice or per-range loop: applied once per area they read as a
// piece that is too bright and stops decaying.
//
// The AreaBinding shape (see `buildWholePieceBinding`) is deliberately a subset
// of the one `showAreaBinding.js` produces for symmetric motifs, sharing its
// field names (`pixelIndex`, `instanceStart`, `fold`, `count`, `ang`, `u`, `x`,
// `y`, `seed`), so an ensemble can hand a real per-instance binding to these
// same kernels and paint one wedge at a time.
//
// ---- RESTRICTION: ONE 'MODE' VOICE PER COMPOSITION -------------------------
// The nine effects own MUTABLE ROTATION/ENVELOPE STATE that lives on the ENGINE
// INSTANCE, not on the range being painted: `strataScallop`, `strataBand[5]`,
// `meridianRing/Target/Mix/Phase`, `processTheta`, `spiralTheta`,
// `latticePhase`, `latticeC`, `tideR`, `tideVal`, `bloomR`, `bloomWob`,
// `driftPhase`, `emberSparks`. That state is intentionally NOT per-voice —
// making it per-voice would mean nine parallel authored clocks and a rewrite of
// every tuned constant below. Consequence: an ensemble may run AT MOST ONE
// 'mode' voice per composition. Two voices sharing an engine would share (and
// double-advance) one set of clocks.
//
// Because that state must advance exactly ONCE per tick no matter how many
// ranges are painted, `ctx` carries `first`/`last` flags. Every mutation of the
// state named above sits inside `if (ctx.first)`; Meridian's deferred
// `meridianRing` commit — which the original code ran AFTER its pixel loop —
// sits inside `if (ctx.last)`. Everything else in a paint loop is a pure
// function of that state, the audio clocks and the binding, so it may safely be
// recomputed per range. A future multi-range caller must set `first` true on
// its first call of a tick and `last` true on its final one.
//
// ---- AUDIO MAY NEVER REACH AN AUTHORED CLOCK -------------------------------
// The `ctx.first` blocks are the only place the authored clocks advance, and
// every increment there is `dt * speedMul * <constant>` — `speedMul` is the
// user's Motion-speed KNOB, never a band value. Audio enters only through
// amplitude, breadth, contrast, radius and palette terms in the paint loop.
// Keep it that way: if you find yourself wanting `CLK.bass` inside a
// `ctx.first` block, you are about to make the piece speed up with the music,
// which the aesthetic contract forbids.
//
// ---- WIRING NOTE for `src/v3/lw-show.jsx` (owned by another session) --------
// Nothing in lw-show.jsx needs to change to keep working — `tick()` still takes
// `dt` and still returns a status line, and an engine with no composition is
// the nine modes it has always been. To drive an ensemble instead, call
// `engine.setComposition(program)` (a showComposition Program, any shape
// `normalizeComposition` accepts) and `engine.clearComposition()` to go back.
// The engine owns the runtime: it rebinds on `setTemplate`, feeds each voice
// its own band from the live audio, and copies the runtime's hysteresis-damped
// palette ownership into the renderer. `getEnsembleResolved()` /
// `getVoiceDebug(id)` are the read-backs for a Show-screen voice list.

// ---- onset presence gate (2026-08-21) --------------------------------------
// An ADDITIVE onset term must ride the light the mode already painted, never
// paint over the dark. docs/mandala-effects-direction-v2.md §4 rule 2 scopes
// the discrete onset layer to each mode's GEOMETRY (radius, breadth, contrast,
// spark rate); rule 6 says the beat layer "lifts existing light and travels
// through space instead of replacing a frame with a flash".
//
// A responsiveness pass gave Strata, Tide and Bloom additive onset terms that
// landed on every pixel equally. Because `onsetEnv`'s 0.28 s tau never falls
// below ~0.13 between 120 bpm kicks, a flat pedestal is not a transient at
// all — it is a permanent DC lift. Measured under the pulseStream in
// tests/mandala-engine.mjs it raised the DARKEST pixel of the whole piece
// from 0.0152 → 0.0445 (Strata), 0.0000 → 0.0604 (Tide) and 0.0140 → 0.0607
// (Bloom): clear of the 0.0396 coal floor, clear of the dark gate's knee, and
// the three modes stopped reaching true dark ANYWHERE (28.72% / 33.33% /
// 31.41% of wire pixel-samples → 0.01% / 0.00% / 0.00%).
//
// The two laws are not actually in conflict. "Never black" governs SILENCE —
// the piece settling to a living coal field — and is carried by the coal floor
// and the ~0.03 idle, both scaled by `presence`. Under music an individual
// pixel MUST be able to reach true dark, or the spectrum cannot be read and
// localized partial-ring lighting is impossible; that is exactly what the dark
// gate exists to allow. So the fix is not to delete these onset terms (a hit
// in a band that is loud but already clipped genuinely needs somewhere to go)
// but to weight each by the pixel's OWN structural presence: the value the
// mode painted there before the onset. Zero where the mode painted dark, full
// where the mode painted light — the same "lifts existing light" rule the beat
// substrate's 4·b·(1−b) weighting already obeys, expressed for an additive
// layer. The knee sits above the coal floor (0.0396 at full presence) so a
// pixel resting on the floor is never mistaken for structure.
//
// The second half of the same fix is the ENVELOPE SHAPE. Strata and Tide ride
// `evt * evt` rather than `evt`, which halves the additive pulse's effective
// tau (0.28 s → ~0.14 s): the hit reads as an impact that lands and clears,
// not a level the field sits at between kicks. That matters for BOTH laws at
// once. It restores the dark the amendment lock asks for, and it is also what
// finally moved `responsiveness.test.js`'s onsetVisibility — that metric is a
// RELATIVE rise (peak within 200 ms over the mean of the 300 ms before), and
// the probe clamps intensity to 1, so simply raising a coefficient lifts the
// pre-hit baseline and saturates the peak. Measured on Strata: 0.4·evt gave
// 0.133 and 0.75·evt still gave 0.133, while 0.65·evt² gives 0.170. Reach for
