// screen supplies the facts it actually knows and reads the verdict.
//
// The safety-bearing part is `wiringAffecting`. An install that can rewrite
// the physical output layout must not go out without a bench test on the real
// LEDs and a confirmed colour order. Installs that cannot change wiring (the
// card refuses a layout change unless the caller passes allowLayoutChange)
// only need the ordinary preconditions.

// The one refusal for a config push the card answered with `state: 'staged'`:
// the card is protecting its wiring behind the bench-test flow, so the change
// exists but is NOT installed until it is confirmed on the real LEDs. Three
// screens used to carry near-identical inline copies of this sentence (the
// zone-split variant said "The split is staged but not installed" — same
// meaning, unasserted by any test, so it converged on the fuller wording).
