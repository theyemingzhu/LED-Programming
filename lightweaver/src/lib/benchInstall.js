// Installing the bench config — the ONE card write in the discovery flow, and
// the wait that proves it actually landed.
//
// The blank card is exempted from the wiring-staging path IN FIRMWARE: the
// candidate/probation machinery exists to protect a known-good layout from a
// bad rewire, and a card with nothing on it has no known-good layout to
// protect. So a blank card answers the ordinary applied shape
// ({ ok: true, requiresReboot: true }), reboots, and comes back Ready.
//
// Two things this module refuses to do, both of them settled decisions:
//
//  1. It never treats { state: 'staged' } as success. A staged answer means the
//     card is on firmware that still files a blank card's first config as a
//     wiring candidate, so nothing was applied, the strip is still dark, and
//     the frames discovery is about to push would be refused. Studio surfaces
//     that as "update the card first" — it does NOT grow a stage/activate/
//     confirm dance to work around it, because the resulting probation flow
//     would be protecting a layout that does not exist.
//  2. It never returns before the card can actually play. The old code
//     resolved on the config POST's echo, so the panel entered the probe phase
//     against a card that was still rebooting; every probe frame was refused
//     and the owner read a dark strip as "no LEDs here". Apply -> reboot ->
//     poll until the card itself says playback is admitted -> only then frames.
