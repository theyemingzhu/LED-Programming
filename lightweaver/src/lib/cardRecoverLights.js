// Four surfaces send the safe recovery frame (Card overview, Patterns' LED
// repair, Playlist's physical recovery, and the light-check overlay). They
// used to call recoverCardLights directly with four hand-rolled copies of the
// surrounding ceremony; the card-overview variant additionally proved the
// card came back with an exact ready-state readback. This module carries the
// send plus that optional readback verifier, while every screen keeps its own
// payload, timing, and user-facing copy — those genuinely differ per surface
// (brightness, restart behavior, and the bench-card honesty message most of
// all).

// only proven when the EXPECTED card answers and reports a fully ready
// runtime with LED output up. Anything less throws, so a screen can never
// report "recovered" off a different card or a half-booted one.
