// aestheticLaw.test.js — THE LOCKED AESTHETIC, MADE STRUCTURAL (finding F1).
//
// docs/mandala-effects-direction-v2.md: "Audio may modulate amplitude,
// breadth, contrast, position, texture. Audio may NEVER modulate an authored
// clock or rotation speed."
//
// Before this file, that rule was guarded only by a naming convention. Every
// existing test that touched it asserted on ONE named field (`vr.clock`), so
// an adversarial review was able to add a SECOND rotation rate to a character
// — one that spun the piece 16x faster when the music was loud — and watch
// the whole suite stay green. Nothing in the shipped code does this. The
// point of this file is that nothing can start doing it quietly either.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// WHAT THIS FILE MEASURES, AND WHY THAT IS THE RIGHT THING TO MEASURE
//
// The law is about what the EYE sees, so the primary probe is behavioural: it
// renders real pixel buffers, frame by frame, and measures how fast structure
// TRAVELS ACROSS THE PIECE. It does not read `vr.clock`, does not know what
// any accumulator is called, and does not care how many of them there are. A
// new audio-scaled rate is caught by the pixels moving faster, whatever it is
// named and wherever it is stored.
//
// The trick that makes this work is measuring travel as the PHASE of an
// angular Fourier harmonic of the rendered ring, not as "the brightest pixel".
//
//   - The harmonic's MAGNITUDE is how strong that structure is. Amplitude,
//     contrast, and per-pixel texture all live here, and audio is allowed to
//     move it as much as it likes. This probe ignores magnitude entirely
//     except as a sanity control (see below).
//   - The harmonic's PHASE is WHERE that structure sits around the ring. Its
//     rate of change is the rotation rate, in rad/s, of the thing you can see
//     turning. That is exactly the quantity the law forbids audio from moving.
//
// Because phase is scale-free, a Trace arm that is 23x brighter and 1.9x
// broader under a loud drive still reports the same phase rate to eight
// significant figures — while a rate change of a fraction of a percent shows
// up immediately. That separation is the whole reason this probe can tell
// "it got brighter" apart from "it sped up"; a brightest-pixel or centroid
// tracker cannot, because breadth changes drag a centroid around.
//
// Per-frame phase steps are accumulated SIGNED, not as absolute values. Signed
// accumulation cancels zero-mean jitter (Glow's per-pixel flicker is scaled by
// the audio band, so an absolute-value estimator would report the loud run as
// "faster" purely from noise — measured, that error was 15%). Signed
// accumulation over the same run reports 0.0800 vs 0.0801 rad/s.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// HONEST STATEMENT OF WHAT THIS FILE DOES **NOT** COVER
//
// A test that gives false confidence about this law would be worse than no
// test, so the gaps are named here rather than buried:
//
//  1. TWINKLE HAS NO SPATIAL MOTION TO MEASURE. Its output is a field of
//     stochastic sparks; there is no coherent structure whose position can be
//     tracked, and the angular-phase estimator run against it returns a random
//     walk (measured: -0.92 rad/s quiet, +0.20 rad/s loud, both meaningless).
//     Asserting on that number would be theatre. Twinkle's only clocks are its
//     20Hz ignition-bucket rate and its 0.12s spark lifetime, so Twinkle gets
//     a TEMPORAL probe instead (`twinkleClock`), which measures both directly
//     off the rendered pixels. It is a genuinely different probe and it is
//     labelled as one.
//
//  2. THE RADIAL AXIS IS ONLY COVERED FOR RIPPLE. A rectified, mean-subtracted
//     radial-centroid travel rate was built and measured against all five
//     characters. It is clean and flat for Ripple (0.1% spread across a 2.5x
//     amplitude range) because Ripple's signature motion IS radial. For the
//     others it is either vacuous or amplitude-contaminated: Glow's radial
//     travel is 0.005 units/s of flicker noise, Trace's rectified centroid
//     moves 3.7% further under a loud drive purely because the arm got
//     broader, and Twinkle's is stochastic. Those are excluded and stay
//     excluded; adding them would be an assertion that fails or passes on
//     amplitude, i.e. exactly the confusion this file exists to avoid.
//
//  3. SWELL'S RADIAL POSITION IS AUDIO-DRIVEN BY DESIGN AND IS NOT BOUNDED
//     HERE. Finding F7 decided that audio MAY move the Swell crest's radius
//     and constrained only the rate of change, via the SWELL_REACH_SLEW slew
//     limiter. The radial probe was measured against a scratch Swell with that
//     limiter removed: 5.75x quiet-to-loud travel ratio with the limiter,
//     6.23x without. An 8% separation is not a guard, so this file does not
//     pretend to be one. SWELL_REACH_SLEW has its own dedicated coverage in
//     showCharacters.test.js. Swell's ANGULAR travel is covered here, and is
//     exact.
//
//  4. THE SOURCE SCAN IS A SUPPLEMENT, NOT A PROOF. It is line-oriented and
//     trivially evadable by computing an audio-scaled rate on one line and
//     using it on the next. It exists to catch the careless version cheaply;
//     the behavioural probe is what catches the careful one.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// THE FOUR LAYERS
//
//   A. BEHAVIOURAL (primary) — `structureTravelRate` over 5-7 audio drives per
//      character, spanning silence to full scale, steady and percussive and
//      swinging. Assert the spread of the rate is under 1%.
//   A'. TEMPORAL (Twinkle) — ignition-bucket period and spark lifetime, read
//      off rendered pixels, across the same drive range.
//   B. STATE SHAPE — a CLOSED INVENTORY of which `vr` fields are allowed to
//      differ between a silent run and a loud one. A new accumulator that
//      moves with audio fails until a human classifies it. Also asserts every
//      declared field really does still move, which is the F2 failure mode
//      (a setting that is recorded and then ignored) in reverse.
//   C. SOURCE SHAPE — no audio identifier on a line that scales `ctx.dt`,
//      outside the smoothAR/onePole envelope calls where a band belongs.
//
// Every layer carries its own NEGATIVE CONTROL: a synthetic violating
// character built in this file, which each probe must reject. A guard nobody
// has seen fail is not a guard, so these run in CI on every commit, and the
// day one of them stops failing, this file is broken and says so.
