// should render — absorbing what used to live in two places:
//
//  - nextCardConnectionAction's transport/capability routing and its
//    ACTION_COPY (imported, never duplicated), and
//  - the Connection Center's LIFECYCLE_OWNED_ACTIONS collapse, which let
//    eight lifecycle states override the flow's own answer.
//
// Two deliberate fork resolutions live here:
//
//  Fork 1 — a verified transport whose readiness evidence is still incomplete
//  is lifecycle `confirming`, and its verdict is the busy connecting
//  presentation (the flow's own copy), never "Needs attention".
//
//  Fork 2 — `popup-blocked` keeps its lifecycle diagnosis
//  (attention-required) but stays `retryable: true`, because reopening the
//  popup genuinely clears it.

// Lifecycle states whose diagnosis outranks whatever the connection flow
// derived from the raw link — verbatim from CardConnectionCenter's shim.
