// The phone lens, deliberately OUT of playwright.config.ts.
//
// The owner uses a phone, and a suite that only ever drove Desktop Chrome is how
// mobile-only defects shipped without a single red test — the inner-scroll-container
// overflow in Pattern Lab clipped the screen title on a phone while document
// scrollWidth stayed clean, so the standard overflow assertion never saw it.
// See todo/plans/patternlab-rebuild.md §7 Phase 1.
//
// It lives in its own config because `ci:browser-smoke` runs `test:show` and
// `test:screen-recovery` WITHOUT `--project`, so every project declared in the main
// config runs implicitly. A phone profile there doubles desktop-era specs onto a
// device they were never written for. Same pattern as windowless-playwright.config.ts.
//
// Run it: npx playwright test --config tests/mobile-playwright.config.ts
//
// Converted and green on this profile: pattern-lab-isolation, -stateful, -handoff,
// -live-preview, -naming, -sleeping-phone and -tap-feedback (a locked phone and a
// tapped tile ARE the phone scenarios, so they belong on this lens above all). NOT yet converted: pattern-lab-authoring, -worker, -compatibility,
// and the rest of the suite — they assume the desktop two-pane layout and never open
// the mobile controls sheet, so their locators sit behind an inert boundary.

  // failing for a known reason (desktop-era locators behind the mobile sheet),
  // which makes a deliberate run worthless. ADD A FILE HERE as you convert it —
  // a green run should mean "the converted set genuinely works on a phone".

  // three DIFFERENT tests, so waiting to fix every race before shipping is not
  // a plan.
  //
  // On CI a test now gets two retries. A genuine break fails all three attempts
  // and still stops the lane; a wobble is reported as `flaky` and the run goes
  // green, so the deploy is not held hostage by one bad sample. Locally there
  // are no retries, so a race is loud while you are the one writing it.
  //
  // `flaky` in the CI summary is not noise to scroll past. It is the register
  // of races still to fix; the two already fixed (pattern-lab geometry, the
  // top-bar import Escape) were both found this way.
