// The setup page exists to show the list of nearby WiFi networks. Two ways to
// break that have already shipped, one in each direction:
//
//   - Re-arming a scan after every successful read, while the page polled the
//     endpoint every 1.5s, parked the shared radio off-channel more or less
//     permanently and kept knocking the phone off the setup hotspot.
//   - Over-correcting by refusing to scan whenever a join was in flight. A card
//     that already has credentials sits in Joining almost continuously, so the
//     network list stayed permanently empty and setup could not be completed.
//
// These assertions pin the shape that satisfies both: on demand, rate limited,
// never re-armed, never refused on the basis of connectivity phase.
