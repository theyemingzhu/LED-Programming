# Prune the dead codex/* branches left over from the Codex era.
#
# Audited 2026-08-11: all 25 codex/* branches were compared commit-by-commit
# against main. Twenty are strict ancestors of main; commissioning-full-loop
# landed as ec3a1752 (#112/#113) and fix-wifi-schema-compat as b459873c (#111),
# both byte-identical; software-update-grant* carry only superseded artifacts
# plus one recovery fix that is now on main. Full findings: TODO.md, under
# "Branch consolidation audit".
#
# Deliberately KEPT:
#   archive/codex/connection-reliability-audit  reference for the outstanding
#                                              Phase 2 ports (see TODO.md)
#   claude/led-branches-merge-5k8lml            delete after its PR merges
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/prune-codex-branches.sh            # show what would be deleted
#   ./scripts/prune-codex-branches.sh --yes      # actually delete
